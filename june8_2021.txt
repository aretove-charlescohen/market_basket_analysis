Tasks
Import Solostove data
Worked with a variety of sizes of datasets, starting with 10,000 lines and ending with 500,000 lines
Currently, only using order_id and name
More functionality and differentiation to be built in later
Using previous framework, basic masket basket analysis program implemented
Filename: solostoveDataInport.ipynb
Takes Pandas Dataframe and column names, outputs dataframe of relationships
Used on Solostove data
Should generalize to data presented in a similar format and works better with the smaller number of different products as in the Solostove data as opposed to the previous test data
Issues
Association rules output from Solostove data
People generally do not purchase many accessories so most purchases consist of a stove, along with a stand or lid
Some relationships with accessories (ex: fire starters) but mostly as additional separate purchases
Purchases often don’t include many items
Median is 3 items, but often includes shipping insurance meaning it is closer to 2 items
