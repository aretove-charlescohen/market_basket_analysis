Tasks
Finish work on sample shopping dataset apriori implementation in Python
Used two packages, mlxtend and apyori
Some difficulties with runtime, can improve data visualization
Git
Learned basic Git functions and connected workspace to Github repo
Need some more practice with this
Solostove Data
Looked into the different features included to develop ideas
Ideas to look into:
First use apriori on all products
Batching products together as one (ex: different sizes of stoves)
Many possibilities here, need to look at product line more
Simplifying some products (ex: some are listed with promotions)
Using customer demographics (ex: name, location, zip code)
Using price of items in cart
